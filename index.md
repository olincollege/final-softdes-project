## Running Photo Editor
To run the photo editor type `python Main.py` in terminal.

## Structure

Photo Editor is composed of three files `Main.py`, `photo_editor_model2.py`, and `photo_editor_view2.py` and is made in Model View and Control format. The file `photo_editor_view2.py` contains both the View and the Control since by using Tkinter they can not be separated. `photo_editor_model2.py` contains the Model and `Main.py` runs the photo editor.
